    <h2>Description</h2>  
    <p>'Kwek Kwek' is a beloved Filipino street food made of hard-boiled quail eggs covered in a savory orange batter that is then deep fried. This is usually dipped in vinegar or another special sauce. It is very tasty, so let's jump straight into the recipe!</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
    <ul> 
        <li>24 pieces quail eggs</li> 
        <li>125 grams flour</li> 
        <li>60 grams cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li> 
        <li>1 tsp salt</li> 
        <li>¼ tsp ground pepper</li> 
        <li>190 mililiter water</li> 
        <li>orange food color</li> 
        <li>30 grams flour</li> 
        <li>oil</li> 
    </ul> 
    <h2>Steps</h2> 
    <ol> 
        <li>Place the quail eggs in a pot and fill it with tap water so that there is enough to submerge them completely. Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. Once it boils, turn off the heat and cover the pot and let it sit for 10 minutes. </li> 
        <li>Remove the quail eggs from the hot water and transfer into an ice bath or cold water. Peel off the eggshells once it's cool enough to handle.</li> 
        <li>In a bowl, combine 1 cup flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, ground pepper and water and mix to form a batter. Consistency is almost similar to that of a pancake batter only a bit thicker. Add enough food color and mix until the desired color is achieved.</li> 
        <li>Spread ¼ cup of flour on a plate. Dredge each egg with flour covering the surface completely. </li> 
        <li>Drop the floured quail eggs, one at a time into the orange batter and using a fork or a barbecue stick, turn them over to cover them completely with batter. Do this in batches, about 5-6 eggs per batch.</li> 
        <li>In a small pot, heat enough oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, use a stick or a skewer to pierce a coated egg and transfer it to the hot oil and a fork to remove the egg off the skewer and into the hot oil. Fry a batch at a time about 1-2 minutes each side or until crispy. </li>
        <li>Remove the eggs from the hot oil and transfer into a plate lined with paper towel to remove excess oil. </li> 
        <li>Serve while hot and skin still crispy with vinegar dip or special Kwek Kwek sauce. Enjoy!</li>
